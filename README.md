Climate Change Impact on Agriculture Visualization Project 
Project Overview 
This project explores the impact of climate change on agricultural productivity across various regions. Using Power BI for data visualization, we analyse the 
relationships between climate variables—such as temperature, precipitation, and CO₂ emissions—and key agricultural metrics including crop yields, economic 
impact, and soil health. This project aims to highlight patterns and insights that can inform sustainable agricultural practices and climate adaptation strategies.

Dataset 
• Source: Kaggle - Climate Change and Agriculture Dataset 
• Description: The dataset contains features related to climate and agriculture, including: 
o Regional temperature, precipitation, CO₂ emissions, and extreme weather events. 
o Crop-specific data on soil health, fertilizer use, irrigation access, pesticide use, and economic impact. 
Project Objectives 
• Analyse the impact of climate variables on regional and crop-specific agricultural productivity. 
• Identify crops and regions most affected by climate change. 
• Provide actionable insights to support climate-resilient agricultural practices. 
Key Features 
• Data Pre-processing: Handling missing values, filtering, and normalizing data for visualization. 
• Interactive Visualizations: Using Power BI for charts, maps, and interactive filters. 
• Insights Generation: Identifying key patterns and trends to guide sustainable agricultural policies.

Soil Health Distribution by Country: Identifies regions with high soil health, indicating resilience in agricultural productivity. 
Economic Impact by Crop Type: Highlights economically significant crops across various regions. 
Resource Use by Crop Type: Displays crop dependency on fertilizers, irrigation, and pesticides, highlighting potential areas for optimization. 
Temperature and CO₂ Emissions by Country: Shows environmental contributors to climate effects on agriculture. 
Insights and Analysis 
• Countries with high soil health indexes, like Australia and China, exhibit stronger agricultural foundations, while others may benefit from targeted 
improvement strategies. 
• Staple crops like wheat and rice have significant economic impacts, underlining their importance in agriculture. 
• Cotton and vegetables are highly resource-dependent, presenting opportunities for more sustainable resource management. 
• Elevated temperatures and CO₂ emissions in regions like the USA and China correlate with increased climate vulnerability, suggesting the need for 
focused climate adaptation efforts. 
Future Work 
• Integrate additional datasets, such as socioeconomic indicators, to provide a more comprehensive analysis. 
• Explore advanced Power BI features, like AI-based insights, to deepen analysis. 
• Extend the project with predictive modelling for agricultural outcomes under future climate scenarios.
